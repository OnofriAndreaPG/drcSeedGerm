	Abstract = {The Weibull, Morgan-Mercer-Flodin, Richards, Mitscherlich, Gompertz and logistic functions were each fitted to a wide range of cumulative germinations of non-dormant seed. The Weibull proved the most suitable for describing cumulative germination as it provided a consistently close fit to the data and was insensitive to choice of starting values, thus making it fairly easy to fit. The others provided either an inferior fit or else a similar fit but with a greater sensitivity to starting values. The four parameters of the Weibull function reflect maximum germination, germination rate, the lag in the onset of germination and the shape of the cumulative distribution. A comparison between non-linear and linear fits of the Mitscherlich, Gompertz and logistic functions showed the clear superiority of non-linear methods.},

	Abstract = {Several single-value germination indices, including Kotowski's coefficient of velocity, Maguire's speed of germination, Czabator's germination value, Diavanshir and Pourbiek's germination value, Timson's cumulative germination, Lehle and Putnam's Richards function index, Smith and Millett's sprouting index, and Tucker and Wright's regression index, were evaluated to test their ability to distinguish superior from inferior germination. All except Timson's cumulative germination method were essentially no better for ranking germination responses than data on total germination; Kotowski's coefficient of velocity, Smith and Millet's sprouting index, and Lehle and Putnam's Richards function index were markedly inferior. Because of the ambiguity inherent in any index that combines, into a single value, data about the onset, rate and extent of germination, none of the indices could be recommended as a way of summarizing germination.},

@article{onofri_hydrothermal-time_2018,
	Abstract = {Time-to-event methods have been proposed in the agricultural sciences, as one of the most suitable options for the analysis of seed germination data. In contrast to traditional linear/nonlinear regression, time-to-event methods can easily account for all statistical peculiarities inherited in germination assays, such as censoring, and they can produce unbiased estimates of model parameters and their standard errors. So far, these methods have only been used in combination with empirical models of germination, which are lacking biological underpinnings. We bridge the gap between statistical requirements and biological understanding by developing a general method that formulates biologically-oriented hydro time (HT), thermal time (TT) and hydrothermal time (HTT) models into a time-to-event framework. HT, TT, and HTT models are widely used for describing seed germination and emergence of plants as affected by the environmental temperature and/or water potential. Owing to their simplicity and the direct biological interpretation of model parameters, these models have become one of the most common tools for both predicting germination as well as understanding the physiology of germination responses to environmental factors. However, these models are usually fitted by using nonlinear regression and, therefore, they fall short of statistical rigor when inference about model parameters is of interest. In this study, we develop HT-to-event, TT-to-event and HTT-to-event models and provide a readily available implementation relying on the package ``drc'' in the R statistical environment. Examples of usage are also provided and we highlight the possible advantages of this procedure, such as efficiency and flexibility.},

@article{che_bayesian_2010,
	Abstract = {Data collected in agricultural experiments can be analyzed in many different ways using different models. The most commonly used models are the linear model and the generalized linear model. The maximum likelihood method is often used for data analysis. However, this method may not be able to handle complicated models, especially multiple level hierarchical models. The Bayesian method partitions complicated models into simple components, each of which may be formulated analytically. Therefore, the Bayesian method is capable of handling very complicated models. The Bayesian method itself may not be more complicated than the maximum likelihood method, but the analysis is time consuming, because numerical integration involved in Bayesian analysis is almost exclusively accomplished based on Monte Carlo simulations, the so called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Although the MCMC algorithm is intuitive and straightforward to statisticians, it may not be that simple to agricultural scientists, whose main purpose is to implement the method and interpret the results. In this review, we provide the general concept of Bayesian analysis and the MCMC algorithm in a way that can be understood by non-statisticians. We also demonstrate the implementation of the MCMC algorithm using professional software packages such as the MCMC procedure in SAS. Three datasets from agricultural experiments were analyzed to demonstrate the MCMC algorithm.},

@article{hardegree_predicting_2006,
	Abstract = {Background and Aims Most current thermal-germination models are parameterized with subpopulation-specific rate data, interpolated from cumulative-germination-response curves. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative accuracy of three-dimensional models for predicting cumulative germination response to temperature. Three-dimensional models are relatively more efficient to implement than two-dimensional models and can be parameterized directly with measured data. {\^a}{\^A}¬{\^A} Methods Seeds of four rangeland grass species were germinated over the constant-temperature range of 3 to 38 {\^a}{\^A}¬{\^A}C and monitored for subpopulation variability in germination-rate response. Models for estimating subpopulation germination rate were generated as a function of temperature using three-dimensional regression, statistical gridding and iterative-probit optimization using both measured and interpolated-subpopulation data as model inputs. {\^a}{\^A}¬{\^A} Key Results Statistical gridding is more accurate than three-dimensional regression and iterative-probit optimization for modelling germination rate and germination time as a function of temperature and subpopulation. Optimization of the iterative-probit model lowers base-temperature estimates, relative to two-dimensional cardinal-temperature models, and results in an inability to resolve optimal-temperature coefficients as a function of subpopulation. Residual model error for the three-dimensional model was extremely high when parameterized with measured-subpopulation data. Use of measured data for model evaluation provided a more realistic estimate of predictive error than did evaluation of the larger set of interpolated-subpopulation data. {\^a}{\^A}¬{\^A} Conclusions Statistical-gridding techniques may provide a relatively efficient method for estimating germination response in situations where the primary objective is to estimate germination time. This methodology allows for direct use of germination data for model parameterization and automates the significant computational requirements of a two-dimensional piece-wise-linear model, previously shown to produce the most accurate estimates of germination time.},

@article{Finch-Savage2006_SeedDormancy,
	Abstract = {Seed dormancy is an innate seed property that defines the environmental conditions in which the seed is able to germinate. It is determined by genetics with a substantial environmental influence which is mediated, at least in part, by the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins. Not only is the dormancy status influenced by the seed maturation environment, it is also continuously changing with time following shedding in a manner determined by the ambient environment. As dormancy is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions, adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment. Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that adaptation has taken place on a theme rather than via fundamentally different paths and identify similarities underlying the extensive diversity in the dormancy response to the environment that controls germination.},

@article{ONeill2004_FittingComparingSeedGerminationModels,
	Abstract = {This paper reviews current methods for fitting a range of models to censored seed ger- mination data and recommends adoption of a probability-based model for the time to germination. It shows that, provided the probability of a seed eventually germinating is not on the boundary, maximum likelihood estimates, their standard errors and the resultant deviances are identical whether only those seeds which have germinated are used or all seeds (including seeds ungerminated at the end of the experiment). The paper recommends analysis of deviance when exploring whether replicate data are consistent with a hypothesis that the underlying distributions are identical, and when assessing whether data from differ- ent treatments have underlying distributions with common parameters. The inverse normal distribution, otherwise known as the inverse Gaussian distribution, is discussed, as a natural distribution for the time to germination (including a parameter to measure the lag time to germination). The paper explores some of the properties of this distribution, evaluates the standard errors of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters and suggests an accurate approximation to the cumulative distribution function and the median time to ger- mination.
