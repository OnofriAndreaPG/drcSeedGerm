\title{
Hydrotime model with normal distribution of base water potential(Bradford, 2002)
}
\description{
This equation corresponds to the hydrotime model for seed germination, which describes the time-course for the proportion of germinated seeds, based on a log-logistic distribution of base water potential within the seed lot.}
\usage{
HT()
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
