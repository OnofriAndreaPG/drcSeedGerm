\title{
Field-book for a germination assay with alfalfa
}
\description{
The germination of alfalfa was assayed at 7 temperature levels, on three replicated Petri dishes per temperature and 100 seeds per Petri dish. Inspections were made in several times after the beginning of the assay.

\details{
Every line of data represents a Petri dish. There were 100 seeds per Petri dish. The columns represent the characteristics of each Petri dish. The columns from 4 to 32 represent the number of germinated seeds counted at each assessment time.
