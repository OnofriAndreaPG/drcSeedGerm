Germination assay with Lotus ornithopodioides
}
\description{
Seeds of L. ornithopodioides were harvested in three stages after anthesis and the time course of their germination was evaluated in Petri dishes. This is the original dataset, as collected by the technicians and needs to be transformed into a form that is suitable for time-to-event analysis in R.

\details{
Every line of data represents a Petri dish. There were 25 seeds per Petri dish. The columns represent the characteristics of each Petri dish. The columns from 1 to 15 represent the number of germinated seeds counted in each assessment time. Seeds of Lotus ornithopodioides were harvested at the following stages (A) Green fleshy pods with brilliant gree sedds (27 Days After Anthesis; DAA), (B) green pergamenous pods with brown soft seeds (35 DAA) and (C) green pergamenous pods with brown seeds and moderately hard (41 DAA).
